#Project Summary
This project, the Grocery Item Tracking Program, addresses the problem of analyzing item purchase data for a grocery store. The program processes a text file of item names, counts the frequency of each item, and provides display options, including a histogram. It helps the store identify trends in customer purchases, which can be used to optimize product placement and inventory.

#What I Did Well
I think I did particularly well at organizing the program into a modular, maintainable structure. Using a class to encapsulate all item-tracking functionality ensured that the program was easy to understand and to extend. Additionally, I implemented an pretty basic, but easily understandable menu system that allows users to interact with the program smoothly.

#Potential Enhancements
While the program works as intended, I could have enhancee the file input/output handling by adding better error-checking mechanisms. For example, ensuring the program handles empty or malformed files would have improved reliability. I could have also improved efficiency by optimizing the data structure for large datasets, such as using a hash map instead of a standard map to reduce lookup times(ugh).

#Challenges and Overcoming Them
The most challenging part of this project was implementing the histogram display in a way that was both visually clear and scalable for large datasets. I overcame this by breaking the task into smaller steps, focusing first on retrieving the frequencies and then translating them into a graphical format. Online resources, such as C++ documentation, examples of text-based histograms, and stackoverflow, was greatly valuable during this process.

#Transferable Skills
This project strengthened my ability to use data structures like maps and work with file input/output. These skills are transferable to other projects, especially those involving data analysis or interactive programs. It also hlped reinforce the importance of critical thinking about program structure and modularity.

#Making the Program Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable
To ensure the program is maintainable and readable, I followed industry best practices such as meaningful variable and function names, in-line comments, and consistent formatting. The use of a class to encapsulate functionality makes the program adaptable for future requirements, such as adding new display options or supporting different input formats. This modular design allows for easy debugging and future enhancements.
